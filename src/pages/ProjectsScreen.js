                    This is my Undergraduate Project, where I worked on playing the subway surfers game by using the hand gestures. I worked on Palm Detection models and Hand Landmarking Techniques using OpenCV in Python to detect the hand gestures made by the user and bind the gestures to the arrow keys to play the game. I have done research on how to reduce the latency and strived to achieve the best results in the user interaction with the interface.

                  The goal of this project is to create a Database that will allow the students and employees of the University of Central Missouri to access all the information they need regarding the books they desire to read. By using this Database, any student or employee can access the libraries database and search for thousands of books. We are introducing the way by which the users can filter the books by its Id, Title, Author, Genre and ISBN ( International Standard Book Number, a unique identifier for books ). By this feature it will be easy for the users to search from thousands of available books. We are having Three profiles in this project, they are Admin, Student and Librarian. The student can signup, loginto the application and view the books and their status in the library, request for a book, renew a book and view his profile. The admin has access to Add a book, Edit a book and Delete a book. The Librarian have access to CheckIn a book, CheckOut a book and Make a payment by the user.
